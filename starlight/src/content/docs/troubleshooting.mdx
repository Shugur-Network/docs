# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps resolve common issues when deploying and operating Shugur Relay.

## Common Issues

Start by checking logs and validating your configuration.

- Relay won't start: Check service status and logs
- Database connection problems: Verify CockroachDB is running and TLS certs
- High memory usage: Reduce cache sizes and tune Go memory limits
- Poor performance: See Performance Guide
- WebSocket issues: Test with wscat and adjust connection limits

## Docker-Specific Issues

- Container won't start: Check docker logs
- Database connectivity in Docker: Test DNS and network between containers
- Volume permissions: Ensure correct ownership inside containers

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Health endpoints: /api/stats and CockroachDB /health
- Log analysis: Grep errors and parse JSON logs
