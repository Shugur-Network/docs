This guide covers the prerequisites for installing Shugur Relay. Ensure your system meets these requirements before proceeding with the installation.

## Why Choose Shugur Relay?

Shugur Relay's **High Availability (HA) distributed cluster architecture** with **35+ NIP support** provides unique advantages:

- **Complete Feature Set**: Time Capsules, Cashu Wallets, Nutzaps, Lightning Zaps, Moderated Communities
- **Simplified Operations**: Deploy once, connect everywhere - no client-side multi-relay management
- **Automatic Failover**: Built-in redundancy ensures 99.9%+ uptime without manual intervention
