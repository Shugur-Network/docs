## Why Shugur Relay?

Shugur Relay revolutionizes Nostr infrastructure with **High Availability (HA) distributed relay clusters** - providing seamless, fault-tolerant connectivity that traditional relays can't match.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="HA Distributed Cluster" icon="star">
    Connect to one relay, access the entire cluster. Automatic failover ensures data availability even when individual relays fail.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simplified Connectivity" icon="puzzle">
    No more managing multiple relay connections. Single connection point with cluster-wide data persistence and redundancy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enterprise Grade" icon="rocket">
    Built with Go for performance and CockroachDB for distributed storage. Battle-tested in production environments.
